title: Ultimate Frisbee

I play Ultimate Frisbee actively since 2022 and competitively since 2023, where I first joined the [Heidees](http://heidees.de/){target="_blank"} Open team, which plays national and international tournaments. This year is my second season with the team and it is tons of fun.

If you don't know what Ultimate is, here is the website on Ultimate by the World Flying Disc Federation (WFDF): [https://wfdf.sport/disciplines/ultimate/](https://wfdf.sport/disciplines/ultimate/){target="_blank"}
